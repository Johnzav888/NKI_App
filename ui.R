                                                   This assessment is important because an underpowered experiment (too few mice) can miss an effect that truly exists. 
                                                   An overpowered experiment (too many mice) can detect an effect that truly exists but is so small that is of practical relevance.
                                                   In both situations, resources spent on an experiment, such as money, time or mice's lives, are wasted",

                                                           T-test and ANOVA are parametric tests that rely on certain assumptions and these assumptions need to be met to obtain reliable test results. Validation of these assumptions becomes impossible when the sample is small, which is generally the case with animal experiments.
                                                           Then, a researcher should use non-parametric tests instead, namely the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis test. In an experiment with more than two groups of mice, the researcher wants to do all the possible pairwise comparisons and find out which groups are different from each other. 
                                                           Therefore,  the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test can be used for those pairwise comparisons, in order to find the groups with significantly different median values of the outcome of interest.",
